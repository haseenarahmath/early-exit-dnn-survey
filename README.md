# early-exit-dnn-survey
This work unifies 150+ studies on early-exit and dynamic inference models, analyzing their architectures, training strategies, deployment frameworks, and explainability trends. It provides taxonomy diagrams, an evolution timeline (2012–2024), and open research directions for efficient, interpretable deep learning.
